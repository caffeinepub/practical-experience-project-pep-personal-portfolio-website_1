# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Personalize the portfolio website for Vedika Pawar (Web Developer, 30 years of experience) and remove all caffeine.ai/template branding while keeping the existing pages, navigation, and contact form working.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all placeholder identity content (e.g., “Alex Johnson” and related placeholder contact details) with Vedika Pawar’s name and portfolio identity across all pages.
- Update the Home/About intro text to clearly describe Vedika Pawar as a Web Developer with 30 years of experience, in simple English.
- Update the header brand text to “Vedika Pawar” (or “Vedika Pawar Portfolio”) without changing navigation items or routes (Home, Education, Skills, Gallery, Contact).
- Remove any “caffeine.ai” / “Caffeine AI app” branding from the UI (including footer link/text) and replace with a clean, self-made style footer line.
- Ensure the site still clearly covers the Class 10 brief sections: introduction, education, skills, gallery, and a working contact form (required-field validation and existing submission flow unchanged).

**User-visible outcome:** The site reads as Vedika Pawar’s simple portfolio (with 30 years’ web development experience), shows no “Alex” or “caffeine.ai” branding anywhere, and all pages and the contact form continue to work as before.
